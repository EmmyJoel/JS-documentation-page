# freeCode-Html-Source-Code
Modified and added some cascading styling to an HTML code from a FreeCodeCamp challenge. 
Was absolutely just trying things out, lol.
Below is the link to the page,

P.S, i'm learning to code with my (Infinix HOT10) phone at the moment, so there really are some limitations on my end.
You're welcome to make the code yours and give it that very awesome look you wish to.
