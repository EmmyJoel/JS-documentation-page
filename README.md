# JS-documentation-page

- Modified and added some cascading styling to an HTML page.
- Got the page from a FreeCodeCamp challenge. 
- Was absolutely just trying things out, lol. ðŸ˜†

### link to the page:

- Page link: [https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks/]

### PS, 
- As at the time of making this, I'm learning to code with my (Infinix HOT10) phone at the moment, so there really are some limitations on my end.
You're welcome to make the code yours and give it that very awesome look you wish to.

Here's the link to the live page.
