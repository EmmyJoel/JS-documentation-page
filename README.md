Modified and added some cascading styling to an HTML code from a FreeCodeCamp challenge. 
Was absolutely just trying things out, lol.

P.S, as at the time of making this, I'm learning to code with my (Infinix HOT10) phone at the moment, so there really are some limitations on my end.
You're welcome to make the code yours and give it that very awesome look you wish to.

Here's the link to the live page.
